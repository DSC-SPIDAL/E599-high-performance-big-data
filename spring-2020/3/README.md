## Real-Time Anomaly Detection for IndyCar Datasets with LSTM

* Group member: Yafei Wang
* Summary: In this project, the state-of-the-art deep learning method-Long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is used as DL framework to build a model, and then train the log datasets with multi-features (variables) to obtain a speed-predict model, and lastly compare the predict speed with ground truth to determine if something anomaly would happen.
