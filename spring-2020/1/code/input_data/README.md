Our Input data consists of log files of all 200 cars who took part in Indy500 from the years 2013 to 2019.
We have created some of our own variables like:

- Since_last_pit : Number of laps since the last pit stop
- Since_last_pit_green :   Number of green flag laps since the last pit stop
- Since_last_pit_yellow : Number of yellow flag laps since the last pit stop
- Fuel: Fuel consumed after the last  pitstop. 
        We have assumed that the vehicle consumes 1 unit of fuel during green flag and 0.3 units of fuel during yellow flag
