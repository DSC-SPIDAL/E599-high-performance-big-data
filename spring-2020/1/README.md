The goal of this project is to come up with a model which will predict when a race car in Indianapolis 500 will go for a pit-stop.
Indianapolis 500 is a top-level car racing event in America that takes place every year during the month of May at Indianapolis motor speedway. The race has 33 cars going around the circuit for 200 laps.The distance of 1 lap around the oval is 2.5 miles and the total race is around 500 miles. During the race the cars may have to go to the pitstop in order to fuel up or change their tires. The strategies used for pitstop plays a huge factor in determining the winner ofthe race.
