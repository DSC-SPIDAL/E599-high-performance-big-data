Project :  A comparison of YOLOv3 and Faster RCNN algorithm on the IndyCar Seriesdataset

Member : Imtiaz Ahmad

Abstract : As the project name suggests, in this project I used to models for detecting cars in Indy Car dataset. I compared the performance of the models using : (i) CPU and (ii) GPU. The results showed that while YOLO had better speed, FRCNN had better accuracy. However, due to shortage of training data, in some cases the models failed to detect cars. I hope this project will pave the way for further research for sports car detection with higher speed and accuracy.
