Comparison of Random Forest Techniques over Distributed Frameworks by Rishab Nagaraj and Vivek Vikram Magadi.

This project looks to compare the performance of the random forest algorithm by running single and multiple node implementations on Spark and TensorFlow.

The dataset used here is the Physical Activity Monitoring (PAMAP2) dataset and the aim is to predict a subject's level of physical activity based on readings from various Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
