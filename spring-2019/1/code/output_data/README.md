The output files are the 4 generated files that store the time and accuracy of all iterations of the performance tuning. 2 each for single and multiple node implementations.

The first row in each file corresponds to 2 Executors and 2GB.

The second row corresponds to 2 Executors and 4GB.

The third row corresponds to 2 Executors and 6GB.

The fourth row corresponds to 2 Executors and 8GB.

The fifth row corresponds to 4 Executors and 2GB.

And so on

Both executors and memory vary by a factor of 2 i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc

Executors go from 2 to 48

Memory goes from 2 to 8
