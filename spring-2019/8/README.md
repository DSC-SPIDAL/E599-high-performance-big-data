Project Name: Sequence Model Computations speed-up using
Multithreading for Sentiment Review Classification on AWS Cloud Resources

Summary:

Naïve Bayes is traditionally known to be a common
algorithm of choice for Text Classification using TF or TF-
IDF as feature weighting scheme. In this paper, we explore 
our findings on how a Deep Neural Network architecture
called Sequence Models can be used in a multi-threaded
setting to speed-up training time and give superior
performance compared to Naïve Bayes. The task chosen to
illustrate this is a supervised sentiment review classification.
AWS S3 and AWS Sagemaker are used to provide
infrastructure as a service for computation and storage. AWS
Sagemaker is an integrated Jupyter notebook that can be
used to perform exploratory data analysis and Machine
Learning. AWS Sagemaker runs on cloud-based hardware
offering any required amount of RAM and vCPUs to truly
take advantage of multiple cores. AWS S3 is an object
storage service that can be accessed through a web interface.
Using TensorFlow as backend, it has been made possible to
change the number of cores and run the exact same
experiment with varied hyper parameters.
In this paper, the main focus is on researching the fastest
setting possible to achieve a shorter training time. It is
already conventional wisdom that Deep Learning; if given
enough data is capable of outperforming traditional Machine
Learning Algorithms in almost all tasks.
