Project Name: Resolving  latency  issues  of  the  message  flow  and  implementing  the data  persistence  layer  (IndyCar)

Project Summary: IndyCar is one of the top-level car racing series in America. During the period of each race, different kind of events happen, including pit stops, crashes, mechanical breakdown, drivers ranking changes, and more. With the timing and scoring log data, the task is to detect events interested which can be categorized as the anomaly detection task.

The entire project is mainly divided into 3 phases. Event detection and prediction of race data. Performance analysis of anomaly detection application. Alternatives for message brokers and introducing a NoSQL based data persistence layer.

We were working on  benchmarking the current Apache Apollo Messaging broker against RabbitMQ  so that we could find an alternative and also made use of MongoDB Database for storing the data which we receive from Indianapolis 500 race to support query and analysing .
