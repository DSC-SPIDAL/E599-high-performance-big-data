We have created a shell script that will run the code of Apache Spark and give the output file "out.txt". The out.txt will contain the execution time of each run, along with the number or spark executors, cores per executor and memory per executor userd. The data of each run will be appended in the out.txt.

After each successful run, run.txt will be created that will store the console logs of each run as well.
