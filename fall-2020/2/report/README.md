Uma Maheswari Gollapudi:
-- Exploratory Data Analysis	
-- Run initial data on, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regressor
-- Run optimized models– LSTM, LightGBM, Adaboost	
-- Analyze the performances across both sets of models	
-- Implement best of DL models –LSTM on Apache Storm
-- Convene to discuss and perform final analyses – what’s the best way to perform this task, and what could be done better next time? 
-- Final Report and Presentation
