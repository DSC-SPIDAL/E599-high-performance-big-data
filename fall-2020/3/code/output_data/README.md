**Output data**
Output data is a CSV file consisting of timestamp, track_id, confidence and (x,y) coordinates of image.
1. Timestamp: Time at which the model predicts for a given agent id
2. Track_id: Id for the track for which model is preidcting the trajectory.
3 .Conf: Confidence for single mode and multimode. 
4. (X,Y) coordinates: Co-ordinates for 224x224 image on a semantic/satellite map.

A small snippet of the CSV file is given below:
